**Day 3 – Parameterization, Jobs, and Scheduling (Productionizing the Pipeline)**
This day focuses on turning notebooks into production-ready systems by introducing:

Dynamic inputs (parameters)

Modular transformation logic

Job orchestration

Automated scheduling

These ideas move you from manual execution to repeatable pipelines.

**Key Concept: Parameterization**
A parameterized notebook can change behavior based on input.Instead of hardcoding values (like dates), we can pass them at runtime.

This enables:
a. Daily processing
b. Backfills
c. Environment flexibility
d. Reusability
e. Cleaner code

we used Widgets which are interactive parameters inside notebook to accept inputs.with this parameteriztion,pipelines adapt,jobs run dynamically,Syatems scale.
